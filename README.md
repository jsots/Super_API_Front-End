## Long Term Goal

Our long term goal for this project is to incorporate Dream Teams into the mix, a comprehensive platform that will allow users to create, manage, and share their own Dream Team of Supers, as well as access a vast database of Supers from various franchises. All Dream Teams will have the same CRUD capabilities, and users will be able to add them to their Dream Team roster. With Dream Teams, users will be able to search for Supers by name, publisher, and other attributes, as well as view their detailed profiles and combat stats. Our aim is to create the ultimate platform for Super fans to explore, create, and share their favorite Supers with the world, while also fostering a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about the world of Supers.
