# Super_API_Front-End
> Welcome to the world of Supers. There's good, there's evil, and there's straight up weird.

## Intro

Wanna make your own Teen Titans? Avengers? Justice League? The sky isn't even close to the limit. See ya in outer space!

## Long Term Goal

Our long term goal for this project is to incorporate and create Transheroes DreamTeam, a comprehensive platform that goes beyond just creating and managing user-generated Supers. With Transheroes DreamTeam, users will have access to a vast database of Supers from various franchises, allowing them to search for Supers by name, publisher, and other attributes, as well as view their detailed profiles and combat stats. Our aim is to create the ultimate platform for Super fans to explore, create, and share their favorite Supers with the world, while also fostering a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about the world of Supers.
